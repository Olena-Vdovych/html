                        <img src="img/Tips/Carry-Cash.webp" alt="Cash" class="tips__img">
                        <p class="tips__text">With the advent of digitalization, we are now more dependent on our cards, whether it be a debit card or credit card. 
                            But while your visit to the Netherlands, do not simply rely on your cards. 
                            This is a basic travel tip in the Netherlands that always carry cash with you. In the Netherlands, they do love cards but only the Maestro Card. 
                            Contrasting with other countries in the worlds credit cards are not popular in the Netherlands. 
                            However, few of the stores are now going cashless but to be on the safer side carry cash with you.</p>

                        <h3 class="tips__number">2. Be An Expert In Time Management</h3>
                        <img src="img/Tips/Time-Management.webp" alt="Cash" class="tips__img">
                        <p class="tips_text">It is important to manage time while visiting the Netherlands. If you need to go shopping or need to do any chore try to do it between 10 am and 5-6pm. 
                            Though few business shops are open till midnight, most of the businesses are shut down by 6 p.m and museums and shops remain closed on Mondays.</p>

                        <h3 class="tips__number">3. Be Specific While asking For Water</h3>
                        <img src="img/Tips/Water.webp" alt="Cash" class="tips__img">
                        <p class="tips_text">In the Netherlands asking for water is complex. You can get free water only if you know what to ask to get this otherwise you will be charged. 
                            If you are thirsty and you need water rather than asking simply for water move for asking a pitcher of tap water. Tap water is free here 
                            but if you simply ask for tap water you'll receive a very tiny amount of water and if you simply say water you'll get a non-refillable small bottle of water 
                            and they'll charge you money for the bottle. So for better move go for the pitcher.</p>

                        <h3 class="tips__number">4. Keep Yourself Ready with a Raincoat</h3>
                        <img src="img/Tips/Raincoat.webp" alt="Cash" class="tips__img">
                        <p class="tips__text">Weather is unpredictable here. It is an important Netherlands travel tip to keep a raincoat with you. 
                            For all around the trip, a light raincoat and travel umbrella are valuable as rain, sun and cold can all happen on the same day. 
                            Raincoat does not make that much space in your luggage. So, you can bring one along instead of buying one from here. 
                            These days, you can easily find compact raincoats that fit in your back pocket. 
                            You can just take them out once it starts to rain.</p>

                        <img src="img/Tips/Tulip-Season.webp" alt="Cash" class="tips__img">
                        <p class="tips__text">he Tulip period in the Netherlands is quite short. The window of Tulip flower blooming in the Netherlands is only 6 to 8 weeks 
                            and it is not same every year. It may get stretched or shorten. But if you are a Tulip lover then mid-April is the perfect time for you to visit 
                            the Netherlands and see the beautiful flower blooming.
                            Unfortunately, if you miss the window then you should visit the globe's largest flower warehouse "FloraHolland" or Bloemenmarkt, 
                            Amsterdam to see or buy beautiful Tulips.</p>

                        <img src="img/Tips/Trains.webp" alt="Cash" class="tips__img">
                        <p class="tips__text">The trains in the Netherlands are just great, feel free to use them quite often when you are travelling within the Netherlands. 
                            If you are on a budget than Dutch trains are your friends. It is better if you choose trains over cabs. You will save a lot of money and time 
                            The Netherlands is a small country; you can visit different places in the country on a train in a very short period of time.</p>

                        <img src="img/Tips/Amsterdam.webp" alt="Cash" class="tips__img">
                        <p class="tips__text">One of the utmost travel tips to Amsterdam, Netherlands is that visit other places too in the Netherlands. 
                            By visiting only Chicago you cannot say you have seen America same as by just visiting Amsterdam you cannot say you have seen the Netherlands. 
                            Amsterdam has got crowded because of a large number of tourists travel there. As touring the Netherlands is quite cheaper you can visit other places like 
                            The Hague and Utrecht where you can experience the beautiful history of the country and most importantly you will get to visit the countryside and get 
                            a chance to look deeply into the Dutch culture.</p>
