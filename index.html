                        <p class="tips__text">With the advent of digitalization, we are now more dependent on our cards,
                            whether it be a debit card or credit card.
                            But while your visit to the Netherlands, do not simply rely on your cards.
                            This is a basic travel tip in the Netherlands that always carry cash with you. In the
                            Netherlands, they do love cards but only the Maestro Card.
                            Contrasting with other countries in the worlds credit cards are not popular in the
                            Netherlands.
                            However, few of the stores are now going cashless but to be on the safer side carry cash
                            with you.</p>

                        <img src="img/Tips/Time-Management.webp" alt="Cash" class="tips__img">
                        <p class="tips__text">It is important to manage time while visiting the Netherlands. If you need
                            to go shopping or need to do any chore try to do it between 10 am and 5-6pm.
                            Though few business shops are open till midnight, most of the businesses are shut down by 6
                            p.m and museums and shops remain closed on Mondays.</p>

                        <img src="img/Tips/Water.webp" alt="Cash" class="tips__img">
                        <p class="tips__text">In the Netherlands asking for water is complex. You can get free water
                            only if you know what to ask to get this otherwise you will be charged.
                            If you are thirsty and you need water rather than asking simply for water move for asking a
                            pitcher of tap water. Tap water is free here
                            but if you simply ask for tap water you'll receive a very tiny amount of water and if you
                            simply say water you'll get a non-refillable small bottle of water
                            and they'll charge you money for the bottle. So for better move go for the pitcher.</p>

                        <p class="tips__text">Weather is unpredictable here. It is an important Netherlands travel tip
                            to keep a raincoat with you.
                            For all around the trip, a light raincoat and travel umbrella are valuable as rain, sun and
                            cold can all happen on the same day.
                            Raincoat does not make that much space in your luggage. So, you can bring one along instead
                            of buying one from here.
                            These days, you can easily find compact raincoats that fit in your back pocket.
                            You can just take them out once it starts to rain.</p>

                            then mid-April is the perfect time for you to visit
                            the Netherlands and see the beautiful flower blooming.
                            Unfortunately, if you miss the window then you should visit the globe's largest flower

                            The Hague and Utrecht where you can experience the beautiful history of the country and most
                            importantly you will get to visit the countryside and get
